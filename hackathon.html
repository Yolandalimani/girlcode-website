                    GirlCodeHack is an annual 30 hour hackathon held in August, in celebration of Women‚Äôs month
                    in South Africa. This year's hackathon is a special one, as GirlCode is Celebrating 10 Years
                    and this hackathon will span over 10 African cities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hackathon is designed to spark, renew and elevate an interest in coding amongst young women, 
                    in particular those that are in University/College. The hackathon was created to provide young 
                    women, eager to join the software industry with an opportunity to develop some of the real-world
                    skills they need to enter the world of work. Through the hackathon, we aim to raise awareness of 
                    female technical talent and foster a competitive, yet cooperative, and congenial culture for 
                    talented female techie.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The overarching theme of the GirlCode Hackathon revolves around aligning technology, innovation,
                    and female empowerment to drive positive change within the context of the UN SDGs. Each participating
                    team will delve into one specific goal, exploring creative and impactful solutions that not only address
                    the challenges presented but also contribute to the sustainable development of their communities and beyond
